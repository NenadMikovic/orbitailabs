    question: "Which assets does the bot trade?",

    question: "How much profit can I expect?",
    answer:
      "We don’t guarantee returns — and no serious tool should. However, the bot is engineered to balance risk and reward through proven logic. It has demonstrated consistent profitability in live market conditions, but actual results still depend on market behavior, your risk settings, and how consistently you let it run.",
  },

    id: 67,
    question: "Can I adjust how the bot trades?",
    answer:
      "Yes, to an extent. Depending on the plan you choose, you can configure risk level, compounding preferences, trade frequency, and other key parameters — all without touching any code.",

  {
    id: 100,
    question: "How much time do I need to manage it daily?",
    answer:
      "Almost none. After your initial setup, the bot operates 24/7 — without the need for constant supervision or manual input.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Does the bot use AI?",
    answer:
      "While MT5 doesn’t support live AI execution, the bot’s strategy is built on AI-driven insights and pattern recognition. The intelligence is baked into the logic — refined by machine learning, executed by precision code.",
  },
  {
    id: 101,
    question: "What platforms is the bot compatible with?",
    answer:
      "The bot is built for MetaTrader 5 (MT5), a globally trusted platform used by millions of traders for its power, flexibility, and automation support.",
  },

    id: 10,
    question: "Can I review the strategy before purchasing?",
    answer:
      "We offer a clear explanation of how the system works. However, the detailed strategy logic is proprietary — this helps protect the system’s integrity and maintain fairness for all users.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "What if I need help setting it up?",
    answer:
      "No worries. Once you choose your plan and complete your purchase, you’ll receive a step-by-step setup guide tailored to your bot. Our built-in AI Assistant is also available 24/7 on the website to walk you through the process, answer your questions, and ensure everything runs smoothly.",
